## PROJECT NAME

- nxplorerjs-microservice-starter

## OBJECTIVE

- Cloud Native Node JS Express Reactive Microservice Starter Template (REST/GraphQL)
- This project provides complete Node JS / Typescript based microservices template with all that will be needed features for production deployment , monitoring , debugging , logging , security , CI/CD. 
- Reactive extensions based samples are added as well to demonstrate how this can be used for building a microservice API edge-service , a backend for frontend or use it as a base for building any kind of microservice.

## Design Principles

- Use best of breed modules to create a production ready microservice framework
- Based on the 12-factor app principles
- No custom code or wrappers so that any developer can modify/replace any of the modules or implementation
- Design patterns for implementation that can be used as a reference
- Modular , replacable and plug and play code
- Provide a starter for both the business APIs and microservice platform development.
- DevOps ready with code quality, unit & integration tests, deployment automated.

## Features

- Node JS, Express, Typescript , Dependency Injection base
- Backpack (webpack) based - build , development , packaging
- Swagger Enabled - Express swagger middleware / Swagger UI integration
- GraphQL based on Apollo Server 2.0 with JWT security , data loader and REST data source samples
- Support for GraphQL SDL via graphql-import
- GraphQL mock resolvers (optional) during development - graphql-tools
- GraphQL based client wrapper APIs - graphql-request
- REST APIs - using Inversify Controller
- Externalized Configuration - DotEnv (Settings, Env specific API URLs)
- Tests - Jest , SuperTest , GraphQL Tester. Infrastructure for automated unit and integration tests
- Code Coverage - Istanbul
- Code Quality - tslint
