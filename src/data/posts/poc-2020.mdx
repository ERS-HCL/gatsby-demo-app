## Introduction

**Purpose** of this contest is to develop capability, identify and make reusable components and, where possible, use it in customer demos.

## Timeline 

-	Two to Three months
-	Demo and evaluation at the end of the project

## Evaluation 

-	A panel would evaluate at the end
-	There would be a recommendation/nomination for award based on the evaluation outcome

## Participation

-	You can participate as an individual or team (not more than 3 in a group)
-	Guides/Mentors will explain project/guide you through in case of need (after registering for the PoC)

## Proof of Concept Project List
The list of PoCs from which you can choose are:

### Microservices

-   Application auto-scaling instrumentation and orchestration.

### Serverless Computing   

-   Framework of application to run on AWS Lambda and Azure Service Fabric with minimal porting.
-   Applicable for MultiCloud strategy in long term..

### Block Chain

-   Design files changes tracked and managed using Blockchain Ethereum based Smart Contract for P2P Car rental

### GPU Computing

-   Using GPU in number crunching algorithm/activities using standard programming frameworks
-   Ability to identify the GPU offloads in any given problem, model the solution and develop code to run the solution on the GPU infrastructure (single chip or a large cluster)
-   Find shortest path for a delivery route using low level CUDA programming with adjacent matrices.
-   There are high level frameworks (GraphQL) and Cloud APIs, but the idea is to develop capability in GPU

### Programming using CUDA

-   Develop capability in developing / migrating solutions to native GPU databases (example BlazingSQL, Kinetica, Sqream )

### ML/DL

-   Build Component using Weibull Analysis for estimating Remaining Useful Life of an asset.
-   Creating reusable solution from a TKT auto assignation system end to end pipeline for deploying a ML/DL model including model scores etc


### Voice Apps

-   To enable Voice as another channel for any use cases using native frameworks / cloud / existing assistant integration (like Alexa)
-   Develop a Quiz framework where one can upload a set of Questions / Answer choices / Right answer in JSON format and framework automatically depoys the Quiz for consumption on a Voice assistant platform (example Alexa)
-   Develop a speech based application to explore data, create reports and charts etc.

### Full Stack Node JS (with Microfrontends)          

-   Node JS microservice solution using Nest JS as the core Node JS framework. 
-   This should be implemented as a micro-frontend solution. 
-   Atleast 2 (nodeJS) microservices that have their own micro front end that are either linked or use custom Events.
-   Which means this is a full stack implementation â€“ from UI to backend. 
-   The frontend could be using an App shell (that connects the two micro-front ends) or a UI micro-apps are connected via http links for transition.

### React - Design System

-   A show case project that uses Atomic Library components and ready to use page templates built using this library
-   This should be implemented as a separate component library that is leveraged in a demoable React application
