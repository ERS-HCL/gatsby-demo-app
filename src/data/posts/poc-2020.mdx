## Introduction

**Purpose** of this contest is to develop capability, identify and make reusable components and, where possible, use it in customer demos.

## Timeline 

-	Two to Three months
-	Demo and evaluation at the end of the project

## Evaluation 

-	A panel would evaluate at the end
-	There would be a recommendation/nomination for award based on the evaluation outcome

## Participation

-	You can participate as an individual or team (not more than 3 in a group)
-	Guides/Mentors will explain project/guide you through in case of need (after registering for the PoC)

## Proof of Concept Project List
The list of PoCs from which you can choose are:

### Microservices

-   The Microservice projects can be in any one of the following areas (but not limited to)
    -   Application auto-scaling instrumentation and orchestration.
    -   CQRS Implementation - either using an existing framework or creating your own implementation.
    -   Consumer Driven Contracts for Microservices - Leverage CDC frameworks like Spring Cloud Contract , Pact
    -   Monolith to Microservices using DDD - demonstrate this in an end to end project covering the stages of conversion using DDD concepts and principles
    -   JHipster based microservices implementation with deployment on AWS containers
    -   Microservice orchestration workflow solution based on any framework or custom solution - Zeebe , Camunda, Activiti or any other.


### Serverless Computing   

-   Framework of application to run on AWS Lambda and Azure Service Fabric with minimal porting.
-   Applicable for MultiCloud strategy in long term.
-   Event Driven, Stateless, Single Purpose , Asynchronous , Scale by request
-   The Serverless projects can be in any one of the following areas (but not limited to)
    -   Using a Serverless framework like Serverless , Serverless Express, AWS SAM (Automation for Provisioning) , Laconia, Claudia etc.
    -   Contact Us Forms - with notifications
    -   URL Shortner
    -   Notification System with user subscriptions and notifications
    -   GraphQL Server with subscriptions for a newsfeed
    -   AWS Lambda offline / local development and testing solution
    -   Demonstrate separation of the serverless handler vs domain logic so that we can avoid vendor lockin
    -   Create a Serverless implementation with AWS Lambda and the Serverless framework to demonstrate the pros and cons. Is it worth the overhead to use a wrapper framework like Serverless vs native AWS Lambda , just to avoid vendor lockin . Also whats the cost of migration from AWS Lambda
    -   Kubernetes Serverless framework Fission.io based Serverless usecase implementation
    -   Look at all aspects like Architecture, Security, Tools , Housekeeping , Operations, Cost
    -   Look at practical aspects - debugging, rollback, latency (code start), staging to production architecture, how to cleanup and do housekeeping.
    -   Practial Amazon Serverless principles: Amazon has no SLA for lambda. Look at aspects like event injection, how to control billing, billing alerts, security scanning, concurrency limits,  setting up security policies
    -   Serverless patterns - One lambda with dispatch, Multi lambda with shared code, Multi lambda with share nothing
        - **One Lambda with dispatch** - One lambda calling multiple backend APIs
        - **Multiple Lambda with shared code** - Copies of the sample Lambda deployed one for each API / service
        - **Multple Lambda with share nothing** - Totally separate Lambdas deployed with share nothing and one for each API / service
    -   Runtime choice is open - Node JS, Java , Kotlin , .NET etc.  
    

### Block Chain

-   Design files changes tracked and managed using Blockchain Ethereum based Smart Contract for P2P Car rental

### GPU Computing

-   Using GPU in number crunching algorithm/activities using standard programming frameworks
-   Ability to identify the GPU offloads in any given problem, model the solution and develop code to run the solution on the GPU infrastructure (single chip or a large cluster)
-   Find shortest path for a delivery route using low level CUDA programming with adjacent matrices.
-   There are high level frameworks (GraphQL) and Cloud APIs, but the idea is to develop capability in GPU

### Programming using CUDA

-   Develop capability in developing / migrating solutions to native GPU databases (example BlazingSQL, Kinetica, Sqream )

### ML/DL

-   Build Component using Weibull Analysis for estimating Remaining Useful Life of an asset.
-   Creating reusable solution from a TKT auto assignation system end to end pipeline for deploying a ML/DL model including model scores etc


### Voice Apps

-   To enable Voice as another channel for any use cases using native frameworks / cloud / existing assistant integration (like Alexa)
-   Develop a Quiz framework where one can upload a set of Questions / Answer choices / Right answer in JSON format and framework automatically depoys the Quiz for consumption on a Voice assistant platform (example Alexa)
-   Develop a speech based application to explore data, create reports and charts etc.

### Full Stack Node JS (with Microfrontends)          

-   Node JS microservice solution using Nest JS , NxplorerJS or any other as the core Node JS framework. 
-   This should be implemented as a micro-frontend solution. 
-   Atleast 2 (nodeJS) microservices that have their own micro front end that are either linked or use custom Events.
-   Which means this is a full stack implementation â€“ from UI to backend. 
-   The frontend could be using an App shell (that connects the two micro-front ends) or a UI micro-apps are connected via http links for transition.
-   You can explore existing microfrontend solutions like [mosaic](https://www.mosaic9.org/) , [SAP - luigi](https://github.com/SAP/luigi), [SingleSPA](https://single-spa.js.org/), [React microfrontends](https://github.com/unsafecode/react-microfrontends-demo) or any other framework.
-   The UI technology for the micro-frontend can be any of the following but not limited to - React, Vue , Angular.

### React - Design System

-   A show case project that uses Atomic Library components and ready to use page templates built using this library
-   This should be implemented as a separate component library that is leveraged in a demoable React application
-   Technology for the UI framework can CSS or CSS in JS based.
-   The technology choices and architecture should cater to the overall UI performance aspects.
-   The demoable React application could be either client side or server side rendered
-   The design system should have a demoable style guide using tools like Storybook , Styleguidist, docz
-   The projects comply with ES6 coding standards
-   The language choices open - JavaScript or Typescript based implementations
