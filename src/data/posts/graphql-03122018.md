GraphQL was created by Facebook in 2012 and open sourced in 2015. This query language specification has revolutionized the way we think of APIs. 

You can read more about it at the site [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/). An image from the article is given below.

Some of the key advantages include

* Efficiency in data loading through reduced network round trips.
* The client specified the data it requires.
* No more the case where there is too much, or too little data being returned via REST APIs
* Parallel execution for resource requests with data being returned even for partially failed requests
* Efficient caching and batching of requests
* Graceful handling of failures
* No more versioning of APIs, the GraphQL schema can evolve.

We are seeing a major shift towards graphQL and this will affect the way we build our next generation web applications. One of the de-facto standard pattern is to use an implementation of redux for UI state management. There is a need combine with the ability to interact with GraphQL APIs and manage state of the application as well and do it for multiple UI frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.
This is where [apollo client and apollo-link-state](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/the-future-of-state-management-dd410864cae2) come in. An image from the article is given below.

Recently apollo launched a new npm library called `apollo-boost` which will reduce a lot of the setup and boiler plate required to get all of this running.

Challenge for us to take up

* Explore `apollo-link-state` and `apollo-boost` and build a web app in any of the UI frameworks of choice powered by `apollo`, using GraphQL APIs. Happy Coding!!
