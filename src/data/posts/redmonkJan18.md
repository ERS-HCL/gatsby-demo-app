## Some highlights

* `Swift` has been one of the consistent movers up and is at #10 in the list now.
* `Go` has seen a slight decline after holding steady for the last two quarters.
* `Kotlin` has seen significant activity with a strong backing of the Spring Foundation and Spring 5 as well as in the mobile developer community.
* `TypeScript` jumped three spots and is seen being used both for the client UI framework development as well as for server side. Good IDE support, type safety and advanced ES6/7 feature support.
* `JavaScript` continues to be at the top. We do see most of the new projects using ES6/7 with Babel which also has as good IDE support as TypeScript.
